            <p>Like many people I struggled to keep my plants healthly.</p>
            <p>I would always struggle to know if the plant had enoogh water or too much water which led to problems with keeping plants well.</p>
            <p>I thought there should be a way to keep my plant alive with minimal effort.</p>
            <p>I then devided to put a bunch of effort into designing something that would water my plant.</p>

                    <p>Here is my first attempt at building an autimated plant waterer. It consisted of a Arduino Uno, Moisture sensor, Accelerometer, 3 Mini Pumps, an LCD Display, a Relay, a water level sensor, and finally alot of cables.</p>
                    <p>What I learned from this build was that it is very hard to get an accurate read of the moisture level of a pot of soil without having a very long moisture sensor. I also learned that using a rule for activating the pumps such as</p>
