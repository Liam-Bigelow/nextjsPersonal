            <p>I've always been a bit of an inventor; from the first time I made a simple circuit out of some old RC parts and T.V. remotes I was hooked!</p>
            <p>Around 15 years old I became interested in wood working and bought my first wood working tool; a lathe.</p>
            <p>Now I enjoy combining these interests and have been able to somewhat perfect my craft.</p>
